# AI for Mental Health Support

An AI-powered web application designed to provide mental health support through voice-based interactions. This tool analyzes user behavior and speech patterns to generate empathetic responses, offer personalized coping mechanisms, and connect users to professional help when necessary.

## üß† Key Features

- üé§ **Voice-to-Voice Support**: Users can speak freely, and the AI responds with natural-sounding speech.
- üßò **Personalized Coping Mechanisms**: Based on user input, the AI suggests tailored support strategies.
- üåê **Intelligent AI Responses**: Integrates with Google's Gemini for understanding and generating natural, context-aware responses.
- üîä **Customizable Voice Settings**: Users can adjust voice speed, style, and emotional tone.
- üìä **User Behavior Tracking** *(optional)*: Detects speech frequency and tone to identify stress or emotional shifts.
- üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Crisis Escalation Support** *(future scope)*: Automatically offers professional help if high-risk behavior is detected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Speaks**: Audio is recorded through the browser and sent to the backend.
2. **Speech Recognition**: The recorded voice is transcribed using the STT module.
3. **AI Understanding**: The transcription is passed to the Gemini API for intelligent, empathetic responses.
4. **Speech Generation**: ElevenLabs synthesizes a human-like voice response using selected voice settings.
5. **Playback**: The AI‚Äôs response is played back to the user.
6. **Feedback Loop**: Optional logging and monitoring for emotional well-being tracking.

## üîß Settings Management

Users can customize their experience through the **Settings Page**, adjusting:

- Voice (e.g. Rachel, Domi, etc.)
- Speed, stability, style, and similarity boost
- Mic sensitivity
- Ability to delete previous voice data

All settings persist between sessions and directly influence the ElevenLabs voice model.

When User stops recording, the AI model is processing the input to come up with a speech output.
